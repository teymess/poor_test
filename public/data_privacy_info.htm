    <h4><b>Purpose of Data Processing</b></h4>

    <ul>

        <li>
            All the data collected in this survey are provided on a voluntary basis and will
            be stored, processed and used by the researchers at the University of Göttingen
            and Heidelberg University for the purpose of
            writing academic research papers.
        </li>

        <li>
            Any personal data gathered for the aforementioned purposes will be collected, processed and used with respect to
            the data protection acts of
            the EU General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR).
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h4><b>Type of Data Processed</b></h4>

    <ul>


        <li>
            In addition to the information you provide voluntarily, we will collect your IP
            address and other paradata
            provided by your browser (such as name and version). We will use this
            information together with the rest of your
            survey responses solely for the purpose of ensuring that all the data you
            provided is truthful and uniquely
            associated with a single human person. After this evaluation is completed, we
            will delete this additional information forever.
        </li>

        <li>
            If you decide to share your email address, you may be contacted in the
            future to receive invites to participate in future academic
            studies.
        </li>

        <li>
            Email addresses will be stored separately from the rest of the survey
            responses and linked via a
            pseudonym that only the researchers at Heidelberg University
            may decrypt.
        </li>

    </ul>

    <h4><b>Duration of Storage</b></h4>

    <ul>

        <li>
            The information collected in this survey will be stored indefinitely and may be
            made available to other academic researchers after the study is
            completed. In doing so, we will remove any potentially identifying information
            (if any was provided). Examples of
            other studies include meta-analyses of similar studies that aggregate
            information from multiple participants from
            a broad range of studies. Researchers of future studies will not ask your
            permission for each new study and will
            not have access to any information that could potentially identify you, nor will
            they attempt to do so.
        </li>

        <li>
            Participants reserve the right to access, rectify, or delete their
            personal data gathered through our studies. <em>Important!
            If no email address is provided, the data is already stored anonymously
            and can no longer be modified.</em>
        </li>
