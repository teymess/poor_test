    <p>
        We would like to invite you to participate in an
        online survey.
    </p>

    <p>
        <strong>You must be at least 18 years old to participate
            in this study.</strong>
        </p>

        <p>
            <strong>The decision to participate is voluntary.
            </strong> You do not have to
                participate and you can refuse to answer any
                question. Even if you begin the web-based survey, you
                can stop at any time by closing your browser.
            </p>

            <p>
                <strong>There are no foreseeable risks or discomforts to you
                    for taking part in this survey.</strong> We anticipate that
                    it will take about
                    <em>10-15 minutes</em> to complete this
                    task. However, you will only be rewarded for completing
                    the task, not for the length of time you participate.
                </p>

                <p>
                    You will be compensated for completion of this
                    survey with a fixed reward of <em>$1.00 US Dollar</em> and
                    an additional bonus of up to <em>$1.50 US Dollar</em>.
                    Submitted HITs will be <strong>rejected</strong>
                    if they are completed in a manner that appears to be random,
                    incomplete, or otherwise negligent.
                </p>

                <p>
                    <strong>Your part in this survey is anonymized to the
                        researchers.</strong> Researchers at Heidelberg University
                        may have access to anonymized experimental research
                        records. However, because of the nature of electronic
                        systems, it is possible that respondents could be
                        identified by some electronic record associated with the
                        response. Neither the researcher nor anyone involved with
                        this study will be capturing those data. Any reports or
                        publications based on this research will use only group
                        data and will not identify you or any individual as being
                        affiliated with this project. The only
                        individually-identifying data we receive from Mechanical
                        Turk are your unique identifier and your country.  Your
                        data are also stored on Mechanical Turk's servers, and the
                        data there are subject to the Amazon Mechanical Turk
                        Privacy Notice and Participation Agreement.
