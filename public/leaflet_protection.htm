      With this survey, us, as academic researchers at the University of GÃ¶ttingen and Heidelberg University in Germany, aim to study how people form beliefs about the impact of
      pollution on their own health and general wellbeing. Our underlying purpose is to raise awareness regarding the potential damages that
      air pollution poses and motivate people to take action against it, while recognizing the challenges it raises.<br />
    </p>
    <p>
      Reducing air pollution addresses the problem at its roots. Additionally, there are actions everyone of us can take to reduce the impacts
      of air pollution on our health. See the image below for a list of things you can do to protect yourself.
