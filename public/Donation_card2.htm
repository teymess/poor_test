                You now have the opportunity to contribute
                <b>a part</b> or <b>all</b> of the bonus of $1.50</b> to a non-governmental organization (NGO) that fights air pollution
                in India.
                 <!-- and leads projects in your district. -->
                <br><br>
                Whatever you decide, we will accurately implement your decision. If you choose to fight air pollution,
                we will transfer the amount you choose to the selected organization.
                The rest of the bonus, together with the base reward, will go to you after your HIT is approved.
                <br><br>
                Once the study has concluded, contribution receipts will be displayed on the webpage of our research group

                <b>Remember!</b>
                <br>
                On average, people living in your state lose <b> <span id="districtLYL">-</span> years of life</b> because of air pollution with some people losing more than that and some people less.
                <br>
                In your opinion, you are likely to lose <b> <span id="ownLYL">-</span> years of life</b> because of air pollution.
